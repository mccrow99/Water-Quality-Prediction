# Data Dictionary

A catalog of every dataset in this repository: where it comes from, and what each
column measures. Paths reflect the current `data/tabular/01_raw` · `02_clean`
layout (raw inputs, cleaned tables). The cleaned tables below are combined into
merged modeling tables under `data/03a_merge_primary/` · `03b_merge_secondary/` ·
`03c_merge_tertiary/` — all now built; see `MERGE.md` for the per-stage inventory,
keys, and the terminal `epa-full.csv` modeling table.

Units are noted where the source defines them. Identifiers used to join datasets
together are flagged as **(key)**.

## Raw Data Footprint

Sizes of the **raw** downloaded inputs only (under `data/.../01_raw/` and the raw
`data/spatial/01_raw/` layers); cleaned/merged derivatives are excluded. Rows
exclude the header; `MB` is on-disk file size (1 MB = 1024 KB).

## Water Quality

**Source:** U.S. EPA / USGS **Water Quality Portal (WQX)** — the federated
STORET + NWIS feed. <https://www.waterqualitydata.us/>. `ProviderName`
distinguishes the originating system (`NWIS` = USGS, `STORET` = EPA/state).

### EPA Water Quality Measurements (`epa-wq.csv`)

This table records individual chemical, physical, and biological measurements collected at Iowa stream and lake monitoring stations. Each row captures a single analyte result — such as nitrate concentration, dissolved oxygen, or E. coli count — along with the sampling date, depth, method, and quality flags. It is the primary response-variable source for the project, linking ~971K observations across 23 standardized parameters to specific locations and times.

### Cleaned water quality outputs

`data/tabular/02_clean/water-quality/epa-wq-clean.csv` — wide table, one row per
`MonitoringLocationIdentifier` + `ActivityStartDateTime`, with a
`<parameter>_value` / `<parameter>_unit` column pair for each of 23 standardized
parameters (temperature, DO, pH, nitrate, nitrite, nitrate+nitrite, ammonia,
Kjeldahl N, orthophosphate, phosphate-P, total P, chloride, sulfate, specific
conductance, TDS, TSS, turbidity, E. coli, chlorophyll a, microcystin, atrazine,

## Climate

### ISU / IEM Climate (`isu-climate.csv`)

**Source:** Iowa State University **Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM)**, daily ASOS/AWOS
station summaries. <https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/> (request endpoint
`/cgi-bin/request/daily.py`). One row per station-day (~221K rows). Keyed on ISU
station codes that are spatially matched to WQ sites in the merge step.

This dataset captures daily meteorological conditions — temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind, and snowpack — at Iowa airport weather stations. It provides the in-situ atmospheric context that drives runoff and nutrient transport events, serving as the nearest-station climate feature for each water-quality monitoring site after a spatial match is applied in the merge step.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `station` | **(key)** IEM/ISU station code (e.g. `OOA`). |
| `day` | Calendar date of the daily summary (`YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `max_temp_f` | Daily maximum air temperature (°F). |
| `min_temp_f` | Daily minimum air temperature (°F). |
| `max_dewpoint_f` | Daily maximum dew-point temperature (°F), a measure of atmospheric moisture. |
| `min_dewpoint_f` | Daily minimum dew-point temperature (°F). |
| `precip_in` | Daily liquid precipitation (inches). Frequently missing at stations without a precip sensor. |
| `avg_wind_speed_kts` | Daily mean wind speed (knots). |
| `avg_wind_drct` | Daily mean wind direction (degrees, 0–360). |
| `min_rh` | Daily minimum relative humidity (%). |
| `avg_rh` | Daily mean relative humidity (%). |
| `max_rh` | Daily maximum relative humidity (%). |
| `snow_in` | Daily snowfall (inches). **Blank means "not measured", not "none"** — see the note below. |
| `snowd_in` | Snow depth on the ground (inches). **Blank means "not measured", not "none"** — see the note below. |
| `min_feel` | Daily minimum "feels-like" temperature (°F) — wind chill / heat index. |
| `avg_feel` | Daily mean "feels-like" temperature (°F). |
| `max_feel` | Daily maximum "feels-like" temperature (°F). |
| `max_wind_speed_kts` | Daily maximum sustained wind speed (knots). |
| `climo_high_f` | Climatological normal high temperature for that calendar day (°F). |
| `climo_low_f` | Climatological normal low temperature for that calendar day (°F). |

> **A blank `snow_in` / `snowd_in` is "not measured", not "no snow".** These read
> like *event* variables that the feed reports only when snow occurs, and the
> cleaner used to zero-fill them on that basis. The data contradicts it three
> ways: the feed already encodes zero explicitly (28,434 literal `0.0` values in
> `snow_in`); the null rate is **flat across the calendar** — 86.5% in January
> against 85.9% in July, a spread under 3pp where a real event variable would
> span ~50pp; and the missingness is a **station** property — of 62 stations,
> **45 never report snow at all**, one reports only `0.0`, and eight more report
> only a `0.0001`-inch sentinel, leaving just **eight stations with genuine snow
> data** (six of them — DSM, DVN, DBQ, ALO, SUX, MCW — covering ~84% of days).
> The zero-fill therefore fabricated **189,974** values against 28,434 real
> zeros, ~87% of the column. Both columns now keep their `NaN`s; genuinely
> reported zeros stay zeros. This is the same reasoning already applied to
> `precip_in`.

### PRISM Climate (`prism-iowa-climate.csv`)

**Source:** **PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University** — 4 km gridded daily
climate, sampled at each EPA water-quality station coordinate. <https://prism.oregonstate.edu/>
(API `services.nacse.org/prism/data/get/us/4km/`). Complete grid of ~1,666
stations × ~2,464 days (~4.1M rows). Joins **directly** to WQ sites — `station_id`
is the EPA `MonitoringLocationIdentifier`.

This dataset provides gridded daily temperature, precipitation, and dew-point estimates extracted at the exact coordinates of each water-quality monitoring station. Because PRISM interpolates climate surfaces across the full landscape, it gives complete, gap-free climate records for every WQ site without the spatial-matching uncertainty that comes with the nearest-airport IEM data.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `date` | Calendar date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `station_id` | **(key)** EPA WQX `MonitoringLocationIdentifier` the grid was sampled at. |
| `tmax` | Daily maximum air temperature (°C). |
| `tmin` | Daily minimum air temperature (°C). |
| `ppt` | Daily total precipitation (mm). |
| `tdmean` | Daily mean dew-point temperature (°C). |

Cleaned output: [`prism-iowa-climate-clean.csv`](#cleaned-climate-outputs).

### Cleaned climate outputs

Produced by the notebooks in `src/02_clean/tabular/climate/`. Both tables stay
one-row-per-station-day and are range-validated against generous physical bounds
(values outside them are nulled, not clipped); gaps are left as blanks for the
modeling step to handle rather than imputed here.

**`data/tabular/02_clean/climate/isu-climate-clean.csv`** (~221K station-day rows)
— the ISU/IEM feed, keyed `station` + `day`, every variable range-validated, all
rows retained. Schema matches the [raw table above](#isu--iem-climate--isu-climatecsv)
except that every temperature-bearing column is **converted from °F to °C and
renamed with a `_c` suffix**, matching the `prism_tmax_c`-style convention used
by the PRISM cleaner:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `max_temp_c` | Daily maximum air temperature (°C). |
| `min_temp_c` | Daily minimum air temperature (°C). |
| `max_dewpoint_c` | Daily maximum dew-point temperature (°C). |
| `min_dewpoint_c` | Daily minimum dew-point temperature (°C). |
| `min_feel_c` | Daily minimum "feels-like" temperature (°C) — wind chill / heat index. |
| `avg_feel_c` | Daily mean "feels-like" temperature (°C). |
| `max_feel_c` | Daily maximum "feels-like" temperature (°C). |
| `climo_high_c` | Climatological normal high temperature for that calendar day (°C). |
| `climo_low_c` | Climatological normal low temperature for that calendar day (°C). |

All other columns (`precip_in`, `avg_wind_speed_kts`, `avg_wind_drct`, `min_rh`,
`avg_rh`, `max_rh`, `snow_in`, `snowd_in`, `max_wind_speed_kts`) are unchanged
from the raw schema.

**Nothing is zero-filled.** `precip_in`, `snow_in` and `snowd_in` all keep their
`NaN`s — for all three, missingness is a property of station instrumentation
rather than of the weather (see the note in the raw section above). `snow_in`
lands at 85.7% null and `snowd_in` at 90.0%, against ~53% for `precip_in`.

**`data/tabular/02_clean/climate/prism-iowa-climate-clean.csv`** (~4.1M
station-day rows) — one row per `station_id` + `date`, **de-duplicated so the
key is unique** and the water-quality join can't fan out. PRISM's `-9999` nodata
sentinel is mapped to blank, and `tmin > tmax` pairs are nulled. The four raw
measurements are renamed to unit-bearing columns so units and provenance are
explicit once merged onto the WQ table:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `station_id` | **(key)** EPA WQX `MonitoringLocationIdentifier` the grid was sampled at. |
| `date` | Calendar date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `prism_tmax_c` | Daily maximum air temperature (°C). |
| `prism_tmin_c` | Daily minimum air temperature (°C). |
| `prism_ppt_mm` | Daily total precipitation (mm). |
| `prism_tdmean_c` | Daily mean dew-point temperature (°C). |

### USDA NASS tables

**Source:** **USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Quick Stats.**
<https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/>. Four files
(`Crop-Yields.csv`, `Livestock-Inventory.csv`,
`Crop-Chemical-Application.csv`, `Chemical-Fertilizer-Feed-Spending.csv`) all
share the standard Quick Stats 21-column export schema; only the
`Commodity` / `Data Item` / `Domain` content differs.

These four tables collectively describe Iowa's agricultural landscape at annual resolution: what crops were grown and at what yields, how many livestock were present by species and herd size, what volumes of herbicides and fertilizers were applied to crops, and what farms spent on chemicals and feed. Together they quantify the nutrient and chemical loading pressure that translates into water-quality signals observed at downstream monitoring stations.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Program` | Data program: `CENSUS` (Census of Agriculture) or `SURVEY`. |
| `Year` | Reference year of the observation. |
| `Period` | Time period the value covers (e.g. `YEAR`, `END OF DEC`). |
| `Week Ending` | Week-ending date, for weekly survey series (usually blank here). |
| `Geo Level` | Geographic aggregation level (`STATE`, `COUNTY`, etc.). |
| `State` | State name (`IOWA`). |
| `State ANSI` | FIPS state code (`19`). |
| `Ag District` | NASS agricultural statistics district name. |
| `Ag District Code` | Numeric code for the ag district. |
| `County` | County name. |
| `County ANSI` | FIPS county code. |
| `Zip Code` | ZIP code, when the series is reported at ZIP level. |
| `Region` | Region designation, when applicable. |
| `watershed_code` | 8-digit watershed code, when the series is watershed-based. |
| `Watershed` | Watershed name, when applicable. |
| `Commodity` | The commodity measured (e.g. `CORN`, `CATTLE`, `SOYBEANS`, `CHEMICAL TOTALS`). |
| `Data Item` | Full description of the measured quantity, including unit (e.g. `CORN, GRAIN - PRODUCTION, MEASURED IN BU`). |
| `Domain` | Breakdown dimension (e.g. `TOTAL`, `CHEMICAL, FUNGICIDE`, an inventory class). |
| `Domain Category` | Specific category within the domain (e.g. a chemical name, a herd-size band). |
| `Value` | The reported numeric value (comma-formatted; unit is embedded in `Data Item`). |
| `CV (%)` | Coefficient of variation (%) — the sampling reliability of survey estimates. |

### Cleaned USDA NASS outputs

One cleaning notebook per source file lives in
`src/02_clean/tabular/agriculture/`; each writes a tidy table to
`data/tabular/02_clean/agriculture/`. **Conventions shared by all four:**

- The packed `Data Item` string is unpacked into separate `commodity_detail`,
  `statistic`, and `unit` columns (e.g. `CORN, GRAIN - YIELD, MEASURED IN BU /
  ACRE` → `CORN, GRAIN` / `YIELD` / `BU / ACRE`).
- `Value` and `CV (%)` are parsed to numbers; NASS letter suppression codes
  (`(D)`, `(Z)`, `(H)`, `(L)`, …) become **blank, never `0`**. A boolean
  `value_suppressed` flag marks rows whose value was a `(D)` disclosure
  suppression, so "censored" stays distinguishable from "not collected".
- `Year` → integer; county series carry a 5-digit `county_fips` (state+county
  FIPS, blank for `OTHER (COMBINED) COUNTIES` roll-ups), state series a 2-digit
  `state_fips` (`19` = Iowa). Empty / constant export columns (`Week Ending`,
  `Zip Code`, `Geo Level`, `State`, …) are dropped, and the row key is asserted
  unique.

## Conservation BMPs (Iowa NRS)

**Source:** **Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy (INRS) / Iowa State University**,
distributed via the ISU GIS ArcGIS portal. <https://www.nutrientstrategy.iastate.edu/>.

These two files track the adoption and spatial footprint of conservation best-management practices (BMPs) — cover crops, bioreactors, saturated buffers, constructed wetlands, and others — intended to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus losses from Iowa farmland.

## NPDES Compliance & Permits

**Source:** **U.S. EPA ECHO / ICIS-NPDES** bulk downloads
(<https://echo.epa.gov/>, file `npdes_downloads.zip`) plus **EPA ATTAINS**
(Clean Water Act §303(d)/§305(b) assessments, <https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/attains>).

### Discharge Monitoring Reports (`NPDES_DMRS_FY*.csv`)

These annual files record what each permitted facility actually discharged into Iowa waterways — pollutant concentrations and loads measured at each outfall — alongside the regulatory limits those discharges were required to meet. Each row pairs a specific effluent parameter (e.g., total nitrogen, BOD, E. coli) with the reported measurement value and flags whether a limit was exceeded, making this the point-source pollution counterpart to the diffuse agricultural loading datasets.

ATTAINS is the EPA's inventory of how well each assessed water body meets its Clean Water Act designated uses — drinking water supply, aquatic life, recreation, and fish consumption. Each row summarizes the overall condition of an assessment unit (a named river segment or lake) and lists the pollutant causes of any impairment, linking those assessments back to specific NPDES permits that discharge into or near that water body.

### ECHO Facilities / NAICS / SIC

**Source:** **EPA ECHO** facility metadata for Iowa NPDES permits.

These three files describe the identity, location, and industry type of every NPDES-permitted facility in Iowa. The facilities table provides the physical address, coordinates, and county for each permit, while the NAICS and SIC tables classify what each facility does (e.g., municipal wastewater treatment, food processing, livestock operations), enabling analysis of which industry sectors contribute most to point-source loads.

## Streamflow

**Source:** **USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) / Water Data for the
Nation.** <https://waterdata.usgs.gov/>.

These two files record how much water is moving through Iowa streams on a daily basis, as measured by USGS stream gauges. Streamflow is a critical covariate for water-quality prediction because it controls dilution (high flow lowers concentration even when pollutant loads are constant) and because storm-driven flow pulses flush nutrients from agricultural fields into waterways.

`usgs-iowa-discharge.csv` — daily streamflow values:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `site_no` | **(key)** USGS gauge site number (joins to the gauges table). |
| `date` | Date of the daily value (timestamp, UTC). |
| `discharge_cfs` | Mean daily streamflow/discharge (cubic feet per second). |
| `discharge_cd` | USGS data-qualification code (e.g. `A` approved, `e` estimated). |

`usgs-iowa-gauges.csv` — gauge metadata:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `site_no` | **(key)** USGS gauge site number. |
| `station_name` | Gauge name/description. |
| `latitude` | Gauge latitude. |
| `longitude` | Gauge longitude. |
| `drain_area_sqmi` | Upstream drainage area (square miles). |
| `huc8` | 8-digit HUC watershed code. **(key)** |
| `county_fips` | County FIPS code. |

### Cleaned streamflow outputs

Produced by `src/02_clean/tabular/streamflow/usgs-iowa-discharge-clean.ipynb` and `usgs-iowa-gauges-clean.ipynb`. Both tables retain the same columns as their raw counterparts (see [raw schema above](#streamflow)); dates are parsed to `YYYY-MM-DD`, numeric fields cast to the correct types, and rows with invalid site numbers removed.

**`data/tabular/02_clean/streamflow/usgs-iowa-discharge-clean.csv`** (556,850 rows) — daily discharge time series; schema identical to raw (`site_no`, `date`, `discharge_cfs`, `discharge_cd`).

**`data/tabular/02_clean/streamflow/usgs-iowa-gauges-clean.csv`** (703 rows) — gauge metadata; schema identical to raw (`site_no`, `station_name`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `drain_area_sqmi`, `huc8`, `county_fips`).

## Soil (SSURGO)

**Source:** **USDA-NRCS SSURGO** via Web Soil Survey / Soil Data Access.
<https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/>. `ssurgo-iowa-attributes.csv` — one row per
soil map-unit component.

This table describes the physical properties of Iowa soils at the map-unit level — drainage class, hydrologic soil group, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and available water capacity. These properties govern how quickly rainfall infiltrates or runs off into streams, making them essential for explaining spatial variation in nutrient and sediment delivery to waterways independently of land-use patterns.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `mukey` | **(key)** Map-unit key; joins to the soil-polygon shapefile (`MUKEY`). |
| `muname` | Map-unit name (soil description). |
| `musym` | Map-unit symbol as shown on soil survey maps. |
| `areasymbol` | Soil survey area symbol (e.g. `IA181`, a county survey area). |
| `compname` | Component (soil series) name within the map unit. |
| `comppct_r` | Representative percent of the map unit this component occupies. |
| `hydgrp` | Hydrologic soil group (A–D) — runoff/infiltration potential. |
| `drainagecl` | Drainage class (e.g. `Well drained`, `Poorly drained`). |
| `ksat_r_mean` | Representative saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), mean (µm/s). |
| `awc_r_mean` | Representative available water capacity, mean (cm water per cm soil). |

### Cleaned soil output

Produced by `src/02_clean/tabular/soil/ssurgo-iowa-attributes-clean.ipynb`. The dominant component per map unit is retained (one row per `mukey`); column names are expanded from abbreviated SSURGO codes to readable snake-case names:

**`data/tabular/02_clean/soil/ssurgo-iowa-attributes-clean.csv`** (10,572 rows):

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `mukey` | **(key)** SSURGO map-unit key; joins to the soil polygon shapefile. |
| `survey_area` | Soil survey area symbol (was `areasymbol`). |
| `map_unit_symbol` | Map-unit symbol as shown on soil survey maps (was `musym`). |
| `map_unit_name` | Map-unit description (was `muname`). |
| `dominant_component` | Name of the dominant soil series within the map unit (was `compname`). |
| `dominant_component_pct` | Percent of the map unit the dominant component represents (was `comppct_r`). |
| `hydrologic_group` | Hydrologic soil group A–D (was `hydgrp`). |
| `drainage_class` | Drainage class (was `drainagecl`). |
| `ksat_mean` | Representative saturated hydraulic conductivity, mean µm/s (was `ksat_r_mean`). |
| `awc_mean` | Representative available water capacity, mean cm/cm (was `awc_r_mean`). |

## Land Use (Cropland Data Layer)

**Source:** **USDA-NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL)** 30 m classification, summarized
to HUC-12 watersheds. <https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/>. `cdl-huc12-fractions.csv`
— one row per HUC-12 per year; fractions sum across the land-cover classes.

This dataset captures what fraction of each HUC-12 watershed is covered by corn, soybeans, other crops, developed land, forest, pasture, wetland, and open water — updated annually from satellite-derived 30 m land-cover maps. Land-use composition is one of the strongest predictors of nutrient loading: watersheds with high row-crop fractions export far more nitrogen and phosphorus than forested or wetland-dominated watersheds.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `year` | Year of the CDL classification (2015–2025). |
| `HUC_12` | **(key)** 12-digit HUC subwatershed code. |
| `pct_corn` | Fraction of the watershed classified as corn. |
| `pct_soybean` | Fraction classified as soybean. |
| `pct_other_crops` | Fraction in other crop types. |
| `pct_developed` | Fraction in developed/urban cover. |
| `pct_forest` | Fraction in forest. |
| `pct_pasture` | Fraction in pasture/grassland. |
| `pct_wetland` | Fraction in wetland. |
| `pct_open_water` | Fraction in open water. |
| `pct_row_crops` | Combined fraction in row crops (corn + soybean + similar). |

> **Zeros here are non-detects.** The download notebook writes each fraction as
> `round(count / total, 4)`, so any class below **0.00005** of a watershed is
> reported as `0.0000` — indistinguishable from a genuinely absent class. These
> values are **left-censored at a reporting limit of 5e-5**, not measured zeros;
> the cleaner below substitutes `LOD/2` and flags them.

### Cleaned land use output

Produced by `src/02_clean/tabular/landuse/cdl-huc12-fractions-clean.ipynb`. The `HUC_12` key is renamed to `huc12_code` for consistency with the rest of the pipeline; fractions and row counts are range-validated.

**Censoring.** Because the source rounds to four decimals, a reported `0.0000` means "below 5e-5", not "zero" (see the note above). The cleaner treats each such cell as a left-censored observation: it records the fact in a `<col>_censored` boolean and substitutes **`LOD/2` = 2.5e-5** for the value, so the fractions stay strictly positive and no model reads a bound as a measurement. In the current extract this affects **282 cells across 273 rows** — 97 in `pct_wetland` (0.51%) and 185 in `pct_open_water` (0.98%); no other column has ever contained a non-detect, so the `pct_row_crops = pct_corn + pct_soybean` identity is preserved exactly (the cleaner asserts it).

The nine `_censored` flags are part of **this** file's contract only. `P5_huc12-landuse-bmp-merge.ipynb` reports and then drops them, so the downstream `huc12-landuse-bmp.csv` → `station-year-context.csv` → `epa-full.csv` column sets are unchanged. Any analysis needing to know which land-cover values were non-detects should read them from here.

**`data/tabular/02_clean/landuse/cdl-huc12-fractions-clean.csv`** (18,854 rows × 20 cols) — one row per `(huc12_code, year)`:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `huc12_code` | **(key)** 12-digit HUC subwatershed code (was `HUC_12`). |
| `year` | CDL classification year (2015–2025). |
| `pct_corn` | Fraction of the watershed classified as corn. |
| `pct_soybean` | Fraction classified as soybean. |
| `pct_other_crops` | Fraction in other crop types. |
| `pct_developed` | Fraction in developed/urban cover. |
| `pct_forest` | Fraction in forest. |
| `pct_pasture` | Fraction in pasture/grassland. |
| `pct_wetland` | Fraction in wetland. |
| `pct_open_water` | Fraction in open water. |
| `pct_row_crops` | Combined fraction in row crops (corn + soybean + similar). |
| `pct_*_censored` | **(9 columns)** One boolean per fraction above: `True` where the source reported `0.0000` and the value therefore carries the `LOD/2` substitution rather than a measurement. Dropped by `P5`. |

## Census / Demographics

**Source:** **U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (PEP).**
<https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html>. Two Excel workbooks of
annual county population estimates (`Iowa_Census-2010-2019.xlsx` intercensal;
`Iowa-Census-2020-2025.xlsx` vintage 2020s). These are formatted PEP tables, not
flat CSVs: a few title rows precede the data, then:

These workbooks provide annual mid-year population estimates for each Iowa county from 2010 through 2025. Population is a proxy for urban wastewater load — a county with rapidly growing cities will have increasing municipal sewage discharge even if land use is otherwise unchanged — and can help separate point-source from non-point-source contributions to water-quality trends over time.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Geographic Area` | **(key)** County (or place) name; the leading `.` prefix is the Census formatting convention. |
| `April 1, 20X0 Estimates Base` | The decennial census base population the annual series is anchored to. |
| `<year>` (one column per year) | Mid-year (July 1) population estimate for that county for each year in the workbook's range (2010–2019 or 2020–2025). |

### Cleaned census outputs

Produced by `src/02_clean/tabular/census/census-population-2010-2020-clean.ipynb` and `census-population-2020-2025-clean.ipynb`. The wide Excel tables are melted from one-column-per-year to long format.

**`data/tabular/02_clean/census/iowa-census-population-2010-2020-clean.csv`** (11,304 rows) and **`iowa-census-population-2020-2025-clean.csv`** (6,573 rows) — both share the same schema, one row per `(place, year, estimate_type)`:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `place` | City name. |
| `place_type` | `city`. |
| `year` | Year of the estimate (2010–2020 or 2020–2025). |
| `estimate_type` | `estimates_base` (April 1 decennial census anchor) or `july_estimate` (mid-year annual estimate). |
| `population` | Population count. |

## Spatial Layers

**Source:** **USGS/EPA NHDPlus V2.1** and the **Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)**
(<https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-national-data>), plus the **NRCS SSURGO**
soil polygons. Shapefiles (`.shp` + `.dbf` attributes).

These vector layers define the geographic scaffolding that all other datasets are joined to: HUC-12 watershed polygons delineate the contributing areas used for land-use and BMP aggregation, the NHDPlus gauge-location shapefile snaps USGS stream gauges onto the stream network for accurate upstream-area calculations, and the SSURGO soil polygons provide the spatial extent to aggregate tabular soil properties to watersheds. Together they are the spatial glue connecting measurements taken at points to the landscape units used for modeling.

|---|---|
| `AREASYMBOL` | Soil survey area symbol. |
| `SPATIALVER` | Spatial version of the SSURGO data. |
| `MUSYM` | Map-unit symbol. |
| `MUKEY` | **(key)** Map-unit key; joins to `ssurgo-iowa-attributes.csv`. |

Also present: `cdl/cdl_iowa_YYYY.tif` (2015–2025) — the raw 30 m CDL land-cover
rasters underlying the HUC-12 fractions; `nhdplus/crosswalk/` — the NHDPlus
catchment ↔ WBD HUC-12 crosswalk table linking COMIDs to HUC-12 codes.

### Cleaned spatial outputs

Produced by `src/02_clean/spatial/nhdplus/wbd-huc12-crosswalk-clean.ipynb`, which
reprojects the WBD HUC-12 polygons to WGS84 and spatially joins each EPA
monitoring station to the watershed polygon it falls within.

**`data/spatial/02_clean/nhdplus/wbd-huc12-station-crosswalk-clean.csv`**
(1,666 rows) — one row per `MonitoringLocationIdentifier`, giving the HUC-12/10/8
watershed it sits in. The `P2` merge uses this crosswalk to attach each station's
HUC-12/10/8; the `S2` merge then joins `cdl-huc12-fractions-clean.csv` and
`iowa-nrs-bmp-huc8-clean.csv` onto those watersheds and broadcasts them to the
station.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `MonitoringLocationIdentifier` | **(key)** EPA WQX station ID; joins to the water-quality and station tables. |
| `huc12_code` | **(key)** 12-digit HUC of the watershed containing the station; joins to `cdl-huc12-fractions-clean.csv`. |
| `huc12_name` | HUC-12 watershed name. |

| `huc8_code` | **(key)** 8-digit HUC (parent of `huc10_code`); joins to `iowa-nrs-bmp-huc8-clean.csv` and matches the station table's own `HUCEightDigitCode` (verified during cleaning — 0 mismatches). |
| `huc12_acres` | Watershed polygon area (acres). |

Produced by `src/02_clean/spatial/ssurgo/mapunit-crosswalk-clean.ipynb`, which
spatially joins each EPA monitoring station to the SSURGO soil map-unit polygon
it falls within (falling back to the nearest polygon, within 500 m, for the
handful of stations that sit just outside the mapped extent — typically
in-stream/lake sampling points).

**`data/spatial/02_clean/ssurgo/ssurgo-mapunit-station-crosswalk-clean.csv`**
(1,666 rows) — one row per `MonitoringLocationIdentifier`, giving the soil map
unit it sits in. The `P2` merge uses this crosswalk to attach
`ssurgo-iowa-attributes-clean.csv` to individual stations (carried into `S1`
and the terminal `epa-full.csv`). **Coverage
note:** because stations sit in or next to streams/lakes, only ~1,077 of 1,666
(65%) resolve to a `mukey` present in `ssurgo-iowa-attributes-clean.csv` — the
rest land in non-soil water map units (`map_unit_symbol` `W`/`RIVER`/`LAKE`)
that carry no soil component data. That's an expected property of station
placement, not a join defect.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `MonitoringLocationIdentifier` | **(key)** EPA WQX station ID; joins to the water-quality and station tables. |
| `mukey` | **(key)** SSURGO map-unit key; joins to `ssurgo-iowa-attributes-clean.csv` (~65% coverage — see note above). |

| `survey_area` | County soil survey area symbol (e.g. `IA181`) the polygon belongs to. |
| `match_method` | `within` (station falls inside the polygon) or `nearest` (fallback snap for the ~5 stations outside the mapped extent). |
| `match_distance_m` | Distance to the matched polygon in meters; `0` for `within` matches. |

## Merged Datasets

The cleaned per-domain tables above are combined into modeling-ready tables in
three tiers — primary (`03a`), secondary (`03b`), tertiary (`03c`) — written
outside `data/tabular/`, at the `data/` root, with no `-clean`/`-merged`
suffix on the filename. **`MERGE.md`** is the source of truth for the full
join plan (foreign keys, spatial-match logic, aggregation rules, and known
gaps); this section catalogs each output's shape and the columns the merge
step itself introduces — pivoted wide-format families, aggregates,
spatial-match fields, provenance flags — that aren't already documented in
the per-domain sections above.

| Stage | Output | Rows | Cols | Grain |
|---|---|--:|--:|---|

### Primary merges (`data/03a_merge_primary/`)

#### P1 — `wq-daily-environment.csv` (48,251 × 84)

One row per WQ measurement event (station + timestamp). Direct join of
`epa-wq-clean.csv` + `epa-stations-clean.csv` + `prism-iowa-climate-clean.csv`
on `MonitoringLocationIdentifier`; `isu-climate-clean.csv` and
`usgs-iowa-discharge-clean.csv` are attached by **nearest-neighbor spatial
match** on station lat/lon (an external ISU airport-station coordinate lookup
provides the match candidates; see `MERGE.md` §6). The 23
`<parameter>_value`/`_unit` pairs and the 9 station identity columns keep
their names from [`epa-wq-clean.csv`](#cleaned-water-quality-outputs) /
[`epa-stations-clean.csv`](#cleaned-water-quality-outputs); the columns below
are introduced by the merge itself:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `prism_tmax_c` / `prism_tmin_c` / `prism_ppt_mm` / `prism_tdmean_c` | Same-day PRISM climate at this station (direct join). |
| `climate_station` | ID of the nearest ISU/IEM airport station matched to this WQ station. |
| `distance_to_climate_station_km` | Distance from the WQ station to that matched ISU station (km). |
| `climate_station_name` | Name of the matched ISU station. |
| `isu_precip_in`, `isu_avg_wind_speed_kts`, `isu_avg_wind_drct`, `isu_min_rh`, `isu_avg_rh`, `isu_max_rh`, `isu_snow_in`, `isu_snowd_in`, `isu_min_feel_c`, `isu_avg_feel_c`, `isu_max_feel_c`, `isu_max_wind_speed_kts`, `isu_climo_high_c`, `isu_climo_low_c` | That day's ISU climate values at the matched station (`isu_` prefix added). ISU's own temperature/dewpoint columns are dropped here since PRISM already supplies `tmax`/`tmin`/`tdmean` for this station-day. |
| `streamflow_site_no` | USGS gauge site number nearest to this WQ station. |
| `distance_to_streamflow_gauge_km` | Distance to that matched gauge (km). |
| `streamflow_gauge_name` / `streamflow_gauge_drain_area_sqmi` | Matched gauge's name and upstream drainage area. |
| `streamflow_discharge_cfs` / `streamflow_discharge_cd` | That day's discharge and data-qualification code at the matched gauge. |

#### P2 — `station-geo-soil.csv` (1,666 × 28)

One row per station. Joins `epa-stations-clean.csv` to the station→HUC-12
crosswalk and station→soil-map-unit crosswalk (both spatial joins done
upstream in `02_clean`), then to `ssurgo-iowa-attributes-clean.csv` on
`mukey`.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `OrganizationIdentifier` … `ProviderName` | Carried unchanged from [`epa-stations-clean.csv`](#cleaned-water-quality-outputs). |
| `county_fips` | **Derived**: `StateCode` + `CountyCode`, zero-padded to the standard 5-digit FIPS. |
| `huc12_code` / `huc12_name` / `huc10_code` / `huc8_code` / `huc12_acres` | From the [station→HUC-12 crosswalk](#cleaned-spatial-outputs). |
| `mukey` / `map_unit_symbol` / `survey_area` / `soil_match_method` / `soil_match_distance_m` | From the [station→soil-map-unit crosswalk](#cleaned-spatial-outputs) (renamed from `match_method` / `match_distance_m`). |
| `map_unit_name` / `dominant_component` / `dominant_component_pct` / `hydrologic_group` / `drainage_class` / `ksat_mean` / `awc_mean` | From [`ssurgo-iowa-attributes-clean.csv`](#cleaned-soil-output), joined on `mukey` (~65% of stations resolve to a soil-bearing map unit — see the crosswalk's coverage note). |

#### P3 — `county-agriculture.csv` (2,475 × 85)

One row per `county_fips` + `year`. `crop-yields-clean.csv`,
`livestock-inventory-clean.csv`, `np-fertilizer-clean.csv`,
`np-manure-clean.csv`, and `manure-animal-inventory-clean.csv` are each
**pivoted from long to wide** (one column per distinct combination of their
non-numeric dimensions) before joining, to avoid a many-rows-per-county-year
fan-out. Column-naming templates:

| Family | Template | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Crop yields | `cropyield__<commodity_detail>__<statistic>__<program>` | `cropyield__corn_grain__yield__survey` |
| Livestock | `livestock__<commodity_detail>__<statistic>__<program>` | `livestock__cattle_cows_milk__inventory__census` |
| N&P from fertilizer | `npfert__<nutrient>__<source>_kg` | `npfert__n__farm_kg`, `npfert__n__total_kg` |
| N&P from manure | `npmanure__<animal_category>__<nutrient>_kg` | `npmanure__cattle__n_kg`, `npmanure__total__p_kg` |
| Manure animal inventory | `manureinv__<animal>__<adj_head\|raw_head>` | `manureinv__hogs_and_pigs__adj_head` |

Values are the `value` (or `value_kg` / `head_count`) column from the
corresponding [cleaned agriculture table](#cleaned-usda-nass-outputs), blank
where the source was NASS-suppressed or that county/year had no record.
**The raw N&P columns here are quinquennial** (1950–2017 steps) — inside the
2015–2025 WQ window only 2017 has a native value; use **P3b** instead for a
join that's dense across that window (see `MERGE.md` §6).

#### P3b — `county-agriculture-asof.csv` (1,089 × 24)

One row per `county_fips` + `year`, **dense for 2015–2025**. Rebuilds the N&P
fertilizer/manure figures from P3 with a **backward as-of match** (each year
anchored to the most recent census year ≤ `min(year, 2017)`) and a **partial
manure refresh** that scales the 2017 manure baseline by observed cattle/hog
head-count change. Same `npfert__*` / `npmanure__*` column families as P3,
plus provenance columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `np_base_year` | The census year this row's N&P figures were carried forward from. |
| `np_years_stale` | `year - np_base_year`. |
| `cattle_head_ratio` / `hog_head_ratio` | Ratio of this year's survey head count to the `np_base_year` head count, used to scale manure nutrients. |
| `manure_cattle_refreshed` / `manure_hogs_refreshed` | Whether that animal's manure figures were head-count-refreshed (`True`) or simply carried forward from 2017 (`False`). |

See `MERGE.md` §6 for the full refresh methodology and its "no annual hog
trend" caveat.

#### P4 — `state-chemical-spending.csv` (10 × 112)

One row per `year` (Iowa only — no county/HUC variation in the source).
`crop-chemical-application-clean.csv` and
`chemical-fertilizer-feed-spending-clean.csv` are each pivoted wide:

| Family | Template | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Chemical application | `chemapp__<commodity>__<input_class>__<active_ingredient>_lb` | `chemapp__corn__herbicide__glyphosate_lb`, `chemapp__soybeans__insecticide__total_lb` |
| Fertilizer/feed spending | `spend__<expense_category>__<usd\|usd_per_operation\|pct_of_operations\|pct_of_prod_expenses>` | `spend__fertilizer_totals_incl_lime_and_soil_conditioners__usd` |

One `chemapp__<commodity>__<input_class>__total_lb` column per commodity ×
input-class pair rolls up all active ingredients in that class (the raw
export's own `TOTAL` domain rows). ~45% of individual active-ingredient
values are blank where NASS suppressed them.

#### P5 — `huc12-landuse-bmp.csv` (18,854 × 18)

One row per `huc12_code` + `year`. `cdl-huc12-fractions-clean.csv` keeps its
`pct_*` columns unchanged (see [Land Use](#land-use-cropland-data-layer));
`iowa-nrs-bmp-huc8-clean.csv` is pivoted wide by `practice_type` and joined on
`huc8_code = left(huc12_code, 8)` — **the same HUC-8 BMP values are broadcast
to every child HUC-12** (the source has no finer resolution; see `MERGE.md`
§6).

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `huc8_code` | **Derived**: first 8 characters of `huc12_code`. |
| `bmp__bioreactor_sat_buffer__number` / `bmp__bioreactor_sat_buffer__upd2022__number` | Bioreactor/saturated-buffer adoption counts (original and 2022-updated assessment). |
| `bmp__cover_crop__acres` | Cover-crop acreage. |
| `bmp__crep_wetland__acres` / `bmp__crep_wetland__number` | CREP wetland acreage and count. |
| `bmp__erosion_control__acres` | Erosion-control practice acreage. |

#### P6 — `npdes-facility.csv` (14,030 × 32)

One row per `npdes_id` + `fiscal_year`. `npdes-dmrs-clean.csv` is
**pre-aggregated** to permit + fiscal-year (counts and mean/max across its
per-outfall-per-parameter rows) before joining to `npdes-catchments-clean.csv`
+ `echo-facilities-clean.csv` + `echo-naics-clean.csv` + `echo-sics-clean.csv`
+ `npdes-attains-clean.csv` on `npdes_id`.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `npdes_id` / `fiscal_year` | **(key)** Permit number and federal fiscal year. |
| `wbd_huc12` / `wbd_huc8` / `wbd_huc12_name` / `nhdplusid` / `area_sqkm` | From [`npdes-catchments-clean.csv`](#cleaned-npdes-outputs) — the catchment/watershed this facility drains into. |
| `npdes_n_catchments` | Number of NHDPlus catchments matched to this permit (some permits map to more than one). |
| `facility_name` / `facility_type_code` / `city` / `county_fips` / `facility_latitude` / `facility_longitude` / `impaired_303d` | From [`echo-facilities-clean.csv`](#cleaned-npdes-outputs). |
| `naics_code` / `naics_desc` | Primary NAICS classification, from [`echo-naics-clean.csv`](#cleaned-npdes-outputs). |
| `sic_code` / `sic_desc` | Primary SIC classification, from [`echo-sics-clean.csv`](#cleaned-npdes-outputs). |
| `attains_n_assessment_units` / `attains_n_impaired` / `attains_any_impaired` | Count of ATTAINS assessment units linked to this permit, how many are impaired, and a boolean summary, aggregated from [`npdes-attains-clean.csv`](#cleaned-npdes-outputs). |
| `dmr_n_records` / `dmr_n_outfalls` / `dmr_n_parameters` | Row/outfall/parameter counts aggregated from [`npdes-dmrs-clean.csv`](#cleaned-npdes-outputs) for this permit + fiscal year. |
| `dmr_n_exceedances` / `dmr_mean_exceedence_pct` / `dmr_max_exceedence_pct` | Count and mean/max of `exceedence_pct` across the permit's DMR rows. |
| `dmr_n_violations` | Count of DMR rows with a non-null `violation_code`. |
| `dmr_n_late_reports` / `dmr_mean_days_late` / `dmr_max_days_late` | Late-submission count and mean/max `days_late`. |

#### P7 — `census-population.csv` (17,877 × 6)

One row per `place` + `year` + `estimate_type`. Concatenates
`iowa-census-population-2010-2020-clean.csv` and
`iowa-census-population-2020-2025-clean.csv` (deduplicating the overlapping
2020 year), adding a `source_vintage` provenance column (`2010-2020` /
`2020-2025`). Schema otherwise matches the
[cleaned census outputs](#cleaned-census-outputs). **Held here, not merged
further** — there is no city→county or city→coordinate crosswalk anywhere in
`02_clean` to join it to a station or `county_fips` (see `MERGE.md` §6).

### Secondary merges (`data/03b_merge_secondary/`)

#### S1 — `wq-geo-soil-daily.csv` (48,251 × 102)

One row per WQ measurement event — P1's 84 columns unchanged, plus P2's 18
station-level geo/soil columns broadcast onto every measurement at that
station (joined on `MonitoringLocationIdentifier`): `county_fips`,
`huc12_code`, `huc12_name`, `huc10_code`, `huc8_code`, `huc12_acres`,
`mukey`, `map_unit_symbol`, `survey_area`, `soil_match_method`,
`soil_match_distance_m`, `map_unit_name`, `dominant_component`,
`dominant_component_pct`, `hydrologic_group`, `drainage_class`, `ksat_mean`,
`awc_mean` — see [P2](#p2--station-geo-soilcsv-1666--28) for what each means.

#### S2 — `station-year-context.csv` (18,326 × 217)

One row per `MonitoringLocationIdentifier` + `year` — a full station × year
grid over the WQ window 2015–2025 (1,666 stations × 11 years). Every
slow-moving/annual covariate is broadcast to the station via its watershed,
county, and state membership:

| Source | Join | Columns carried |
|---|---|---|
| P2 | — | `county_fips`, `huc12_code`, `huc8_code` (membership keys only; P2's geo/soil detail stays in S1) |
| P5 | `huc12_code` + `year` | `pct_*` land-use fractions, `bmp__*` practice-adoption |
| P6 | `huc8_code` + `year` (as `fiscal_year`) | Re-aggregated to `huc8`, not per-permit — see below |
| P3 | derived `county_fips` + `year` | `cropyield__*`, `livestock__*` |
| P3b | derived `county_fips` + `year` | `np_base_year`, `np_years_stale`, `cattle_head_ratio`, `hog_head_ratio`, `manure_*_refreshed`, `npfert__*`, `npmanure__*` |
| P4 | `year` | `chemapp__*`, `spend__*` |

P6 is aggregated one level further here — from per-**permit**
(`npdes-facility.csv`) to per-**HUC-8** — because every station's HUC-8
contains at least one NPDES facility (100% coverage) while only ~62% of
station HUC-12s do:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `npdes__n_facilities` | Count of distinct permits in this HUC-8 + year. |
| `npdes__n_impaired_303d` / `npdes__any_impaired` | Count and boolean summary of §303(d)-impaired facilities in the HUC-8. |
| `npdes__dmr_n_records` / `npdes__dmr_n_exceedances` / `npdes__dmr_n_violations` / `npdes__dmr_n_late_reports` | Summed across all permits in the HUC-8. |
| `npdes__dmr_mean_exceedence_pct` | Mean exceedance percentage across the HUC-8's permits. |

> **Agriculture is split across P3/P3b on purpose** — S2 takes the
> natively-dense `cropyield__*` / `livestock__*` columns from P3, but the
> `npfert__*` / `npmanure__*` columns from **P3b**, not P3's own (quinquennial,
> ~91% null inside 2015–2025) N&P columns. See `MERGE.md` §3.
>
> Trailing-year nulls are expected where an input series ends short of 2025
> (P4 chemical spending ends 2024).

### Tertiary merge (`data/03c_merge_tertiary/`)

#### T1 — `epa-full.csv` (48,251 × 318) — the terminal modeling table

One row per WQ measurement event. Left-joins S2 onto S1 on
`MonitoringLocationIdentifier` + `year` (derived as `YEAR(ActivityStartDate)`),
dropping the membership keys S2 shares with S1 (`county_fips`, `huc12_code`,
`huc8_code`) so only new annual-context columns are added: S1's 102 columns
+ `year` + S2's 212 context columns (`pct_*`, `bmp__*`, `npdes__*`,
`cropyield__*`, `livestock__*`, the N&P provenance / `npfert__*` /
`npmanure__*` family, `chemapp__*`, `spend__*`) = 315 from the merge pipeline
(`src/03_merge/T1_epa-full-merge.ipynb`).

`epa-full.csv` is every WQ measurement, its full daily climate/streamflow
record, its static station geography and soil, and every annual
watershed/county/state contextual variable, in one CSV. It supersedes the
dashboard's former input, `data/tabular/merged/epa-climate-merged.csv`;
`app.py` reads it directly, with its own `FEATURE_COLS` contract (29 columns —
`pct_row_crops` is in the table but excluded from the models as an exact sum of
`pct_corn + pct_soybean`; see `CLAUDE.md`).

**Post-merge enrichment.** `src/04_eda/wqi-calculation.ipynb` appends 3 more
columns in place (315 → 318), after the three read-only EDA notebooks in the
same folder (`univariate-analysis.ipynb`, `bivariate-analysis.ipynb`,
`multivariate-analysis.ipynb`; findings summarized in
`src/04_eda/eda-summary.md`) characterize the merged table:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `WQI` | Water Quality Index for that sample (same station, same day), on a 0 (best) – 100 (worst) scale, built from up to 12 measured parameters grouped into eight pollution categories. |
| `WQI_n_groups` | How many of the eight pollution groups the sample actually had a measurement for. |
| `WQI_weight_coverage` | Share (0–1) of the index's total weight those measured groups carry — distinguishes a WQI computed from 3 parameters from one computed from 12, since both land on the same 0–100 scale. |

These three columns are not part of `FEATURE_COLS` and are not read by
`app.py` or the training notebooks; they exist for EDA and as a candidate
summary/target variable for future work.

---

## Imagery & Text

**Imagery** (`data/images/water-images/train/`) — a small training set for visual
water-quality classification: **24** images in `Clean-samples/` and **16** in
`Dirty-samples/`. The folder name is the class label; each file is a photograph of
water.

This image set supports a computer-vision sub-task: classifying whether a photograph of water looks visibly clean or polluted. With only 40 labeled photos it is far too small for standalone deep learning, but it can be used for transfer-learning experiments or to demonstrate a multimodal pipeline that fuses visual signals with the tabular sensor data.

**Text** (`data/text/raw/`) — **20** plain-text narrative summaries, one per Iowa
city (Ankeny, Bettendorf, Cedar Rapids, Coralville, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des
Moines, Eldora, Fort Dodge, Iowa City, Iowa Falls, Johnston, Marengo, Marion,
Marshalltown, Mason City, Ottumwa, Urbandale, Waterloo, Waukee). Each file is
free-form prose covering the city's geography, history, climate, and water
context — not a columnar dataset.

These narratives provide unstructured contextual knowledge about the cities in the study area — their geographic setting, water sources, and local environmental history. They are intended for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or LLM-based question-answering tasks where qualitative city context enriches otherwise purely quantitative model outputs.

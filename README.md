# Water Quality Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project for forecasting water quality conditions at Iowa EPA monitoring stations. It combines water quality measurements, climate records, streamflow, soil, and agricultural data into a single 315-column modeling table, then serves predictions for **thirteen** targets through an interactive Dash dashboard with map-based spatial interpolation.

This repository is maintained as a completed project snapshot, with pre-trained artifacts and processed datasets included for reproducibility. It is organized so the project can be reviewed or run without rebuilding the full pipeline first.

## Project Overview

This project enables predictive water quality modeling and analysis across Iowa using a comprehensive, multi-source dataset. The core application answers: **given the location of an EPA monitoring station and a date, what water quality should we expect there?**

The repository integrates data spanning water quality, climate, streamflow, soil, land use, agriculture, and regulatory sources into one modeling table (`data/final/epa-full.csv`, 48,251 rows × 315 columns before EDA, 318 after). See [`DATA.md`](DATA.md) for the full data dictionary and [`MERGE.md`](MERGE.md) for exactly how each source is joined.

Three scikit-learn model families (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) are trained for each of **thirteen** water quality targets:

| Target Variable | Unit |
|---|---|
| Water Temperature | °C |
| Dissolved Oxygen | mg/L |
| pH | pH |
| Nitrate | mg/L as N |
| Nitrite | mg/L as N |
| Nitrate + Nitrite | mg/L as N |
| Total Phosphorus | mg/L as P |
| Specific Conductance | µS/cm |
| Total Dissolved Solids | mg/L |
| Total Suspended Solids | mg/L |
| Turbidity | NTU |
| E. coli | MPN/100mL |
| WQI (composite Water Quality Index) | index, 0 = best, 100 = worst |

Predictions are delivered through a locally runnable Dash app. The user selects a target, a model family, and a date; the app runs inference across every monitoring station that has the necessary predictors and renders a spatially interpolated map of predicted values across Iowa, along with per-station hover detail and held-out performance context.

Pre-trained model files (39 total — 13 targets × 3 families) are included in the repository so the dashboard works immediately without retraining.

## Data Sources

This project assembles a multi-modal dataset covering water quality, climate, streamflow, soil, land use, agriculture, NPDES regulatory compliance, and census data for Iowa.

> 📑 **See [`DATA.md`](DATA.md) for the full data dictionary** — every column in every dataset described, with source links and a raw-data size table (rows, columns, MB).
>
> 📑 **See [`MERGE.md`](MERGE.md) for the merge plan** — how every cleaned table is joined into the terminal modeling table, with keys, grain, and verified row/column counts at every stage.

At a glance:

- **Water Quality**: ~971K EPA WQX observations across 1,666 monitoring stations, pivoted to one row per station-day
- **Climate**: ISU/IEM daily station records and PRISM gridded daily climate, joined per station-day
- **Streamflow**: USGS daily discharge at ~700 gauges, matched to the nearest gauge per station
- **Soil**: SSURGO map-unit properties (Ksat, available water capacity) via spatial join
- **Land Use**: HUC-12-level cropland fractions (corn, soybean, developed, forest) from the USDA Cropland Data Layer
- **Agriculture**: County-level nutrient loading (N/P from fertilizer and manure) and chemical spending from USDA NASS / USGS
- **Regulatory**: NPDES facility density and ATTAINS impairment context near each station
- **Demographics**: County population from the Census Bureau

**Geographic coverage**: Iowa statewide. **Temporal coverage**: water quality and climate records span multiple decades; the terminal modeling table (`epa-full.csv`) holds 48,251 station-day observation rows.

## Setup and Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.9 or higher.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NullPranaya/Water-Quality-Prediction.git
cd Water-Quality-Prediction
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs everything needed: Dash, Plotly, pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, GeoPandas, and the full Jupyter environment.

---

## How to Run the App

With your virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run the app from the project root:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8050
```

The app loads all 39 pre-trained `.pkl` models from `src/05_modeling/<family>/` at startup, along with `data/final/epa-full.csv` and `src/05_modeling/model_metrics.csv` — no retraining needed. Any target/model combination whose file is missing, or whose stored feature list disagrees with the app's, is disabled in the UI rather than crashing the app.

---

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard is organized into a left control panel and a right map panel.

**Left Panel — Controls:**
- **Target Variable** — choose one of thirteen water quality parameters (twelve measured parameters plus the composite WQI)
- **Prediction Model** — switch between Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- **Prediction Date** — pick any date, or use the quick-select buttons (Today, In 1 week, In 2 weeks, In 1 month, In 6 months, In 1 year)
- **Run Prediction** — runs inference across every monitoring station and a held-out performance summary for the selected target/model

**Right Panel — Map:**
- Displays Iowa EPA monitoring stations on a scoped U.S. map
- After running a prediction, shows a color-coded interpolated surface (`scipy.griddata`, cubic with linear fallback) across the station network, anchored to the 2nd–98th percentile of station predictions to avoid spline overshoot distorting the display
- Station markers overlay the interpolated grid with per-station predicted values on hover, reverse-geocoded to the nearest major Iowa city
- Summary panel shows Min, Max, Mean, and Std Dev for the current prediction, plus the model's held-out R², error rate, and its margin over a same-station persistence baseline

**Color scales by target** (`app.py::TARGET_COLORSCALES`): e.g. Water Temperature — RdYlBu (reversed); pH — RdYlGn; Dissolved Oxygen — Blues; the nitrogen/turbidity/solids family — Yellow-Orange-Red/Brown ramps; WQI — RdYlGn reversed (green = good/low, red = bad/high, since WQI runs 0=best to 100=worst).

---

## Data Pipeline

The project is a linear, five-stage pipeline. Pre-processed artifacts are committed at every stage so the app and notebooks work without re-running anything upstream.

```
src/01_download/   → data/tabular/01_raw/         API/portal download notebooks
src/02_clean/      → data/tabular/02_clean/       Cleaning notebooks, one per raw table
                     data/spatial/02_clean/       Spatial-join crosswalks (e.g. station → HUC-12)
src/03_merge/      → data/03a_merge_primary/      P1–P7: per-source merges onto station/county grain
                     data/03b_merge_secondary/    S1–S2: station-day + station-year context
                     data/final/     T1: epa-full.csv, the terminal modeling table
src/04_eda/        → epa-full.csv (in place)      3 read-only EDA notebooks + WQI calculation
src/05_modeling/   → src/05_modeling/<family>/*.pkl   3 training notebooks, 13 targets each
                     model_metrics.csv
app.py             ← epa-full.csv + <family>/*.pkl + model_metrics.csv
```

Full per-stage detail — every notebook, its output file, keys, and verified row/column counts — is in [`MERGE.md`](MERGE.md). Stage-1/2 source detail is in [`DATA.md`](DATA.md).

`src/04_eda/wqi-calculation.ipynb` appends three columns to `epa-full.csv` in place: `WQI` (0–100, 0 = best), `WQI_n_groups`, and `WQI_weight_coverage` — present on 56.6% of rows (943 stations). These are not part of the model feature set; `WQI` is itself the thirteenth prediction target.

---

## Feature Contract

Every model is trained on the same **29 columns**, in a fixed order, shared across `app.py` and all three training notebooks: 25 station-level base features read straight from `epa-full.csv`, plus 4 temporal features derived from the observation/prediction date.

**Base features (25):** location (`LatitudeMeasure`, `LongitudeMeasure`), distance to the nearest climate station and streamflow gauge, PRISM climate (`prism_tmax_c`, `prism_tmin_c`, `prism_ppt_mm`, `prism_tdmean_c`), ISU daily weather (wind, humidity, snow, feels-like temps), streamflow discharge, soil (`ksat_mean`, `awc_mean`), land cover fractions (`pct_corn`, `pct_soybean`, `pct_developed`, `pct_forest`), and nutrient loading (N/P from fertilizer and manure).

**Temporal features (4):** `doy`, `doy_sin`, `doy_cos` (cyclical day-of-year encoding), `obs_year`.

`pct_row_crops` exists in `epa-full.csv` but is deliberately excluded — it equals `pct_corn + pct_soybean` exactly on every row and was a pure rank-deficiency problem (condition number 1.3e15 with it in, 27.8 without), carrying no information.

Each `.pkl` stores its own `feature_cols`, checked against the app's feature list at load time; a mismatch disables that model in the UI rather than risking a silently misaligned prediction.

---

## Models

### Model files

Each `.pkl` in `src/05_modeling/<family>/` holds a plain dict, not a bare estimator:

```python
{"pipeline": Pipeline, "target_transform": "none" | "log10",
 "log_offset": float | None, "smearing_factor": float,
 "feature_cols": [...29 names...]}
```

`pipeline` is a fitted scikit-learn `Pipeline`:

1. `SimpleImputer(strategy="median")` — models impute missing predictors internally, so the app passes raw feature values straight through
2. `StandardScaler()` — linear regression only
3. Estimator — `LinearRegression`, `RandomForestRegressor`, or `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` (the gradient boosting pipeline uses early stopping)

### Target transform

28 of the 39 models regress on the raw target scale; **11 are fitted on `log10(y + c)`** and their predictions are back-transformed (with Duan's smearing correction) before display. Which (target, family) pairs take the log is decided by a cross-validated bake-off in each training notebook — comparing MAE in the target's own units, with guardrails against targets that are mostly zero (Nitrate, Nitrite) or can be negative (Water Temperature) — not asserted by hand. The outcome: `E. coli`, `Total Suspended Solids`, and `Turbidity` take the log in all three families; `Total Phosphorus` takes it for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting only; everything else, including WQI, stays raw. See [`src/05_modeling/model_outcomes.md`](src/05_modeling/model_outcomes.md) for the full selection methodology.

### Train/test split

All three notebooks use `GroupShuffleSplit(test_size=0.2, random_state=42)` grouped on `MonitoringLocationIdentifier` — 20% of the *stations* that measured a target are held out whole, so every reported score answers "how well does this predict at a station the model has never seen?" This replaced a row-level split under which 99%+ of test rows shared a station with training data, which let latitude/longitude alone drive apparent accuracy. See [`src/04_eda/eda-summary.md`](src/04_eda/eda-summary.md) and [`src/05_modeling/model_outcomes.md`](src/05_modeling/model_outcomes.md) for the before/after comparison.

Each model's R² is also reported alongside a same-station **persistence baseline** ("this station's next value equals its previous value") on the same held-out rows — the memorization bar. Three targets (Specific Conductance, Total Dissolved Solids, Total Phosphorus) do not clear it in any family.

---

## Model Performance

Held-out test-set R² by target and model family (raw scale; **bold** = the model was fitted on `log10` and R² is shown on the log scale, where it is the meaningful number). Full metrics — RMSE, MAE, error rate, persistence baselines, station/row counts — are in [`src/05_modeling/model_metrics.csv`](src/05_modeling/model_metrics.csv) and summarized in [`src/05_modeling/model_outcomes.md`](src/05_modeling/model_outcomes.md).

| Target | Linear Regression | Random Forest | Gradient Boosting |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| Water Temperature | 0.895 | 0.947 | 0.940 |
| Specific Conductance | 0.220 | 0.655 | 0.262 |
| Total Dissolved Solids | 0.421 | 0.533 | 0.432 |
| Nitrate + Nitrite | 0.218 | 0.505 | 0.515 |
| Dissolved Oxygen | 0.388 | 0.491 | 0.467 |
| Nitrate | 0.172 | 0.459 | 0.393 |
| pH | 0.171 | 0.412 | 0.349 |
| WQI | 0.076 | 0.337 | 0.278 |
| E. coli (log) | **0.204** | **0.355** | **0.358** |
| Total Suspended Solids (log) | **0.151** | **0.367** | **0.338** |
| Turbidity (log) | **0.062** | **0.330** | **0.283** |
| Total Phosphorus | 0.023 | **0.175** | **0.189** |
| Nitrite | -0.003 | 0.003 | -0.145 |

Random Forest is the strongest or near-strongest family on almost every target; Water Temperature is the best-predicted target across all three families (R² 0.90–0.95). E. coli, Total Phosphorus, Nitrite, and Turbidity remain hard — sparse/skewed measurements and station-level heterogeneity limit generalization to unseen stations, which the grouped split surfaces rather than hides.

---

## How to Retrain the Models

Each notebook trains all 13 targets, overwrites its family's 13 `.pkl` files, and rewrites only its family's rows of `model_metrics.csv` (the other two families' rows are untouched), so the notebooks may be run in any order:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace src/05_modeling/linear_regression/multiple_linear_regression.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace src/05_modeling/random_forest/random_forest.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace src/05_modeling/gradient_boosting/gradient_boosting.ipynb
```

Each notebook runs in well under a minute. After retraining, regenerate `src/05_modeling/model_outcomes.md` by hand from the new `model_metrics.csv`.

To re-run an upstream cleaning or merge notebook non-interactively (e.g. after a data refresh):

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute src/02_clean/tabular/water-quality/epa-wq-clean.ipynb
```

---

## Testing

```bash
python -m unittest test_app.py
```

`test_app.py` is the whole suite: it smoke-tests the full Dash callback path (importing `app` loads all 39 `.pkl` files and `epa-full.csv`), checks the 29-column feature contract, and runs a live prediction for the first available target/model combination. It requires the `.pkl` files, `epa-full.csv`, and `model_metrics.csv` to be present.

## Status

The full pipeline — download through modeling — is built and reproducible from committed artifacts. All 39 models (13 targets × 3 families) are trained and stored in the repository, and the dashboard launches locally with a single command for interactive prediction and visualization across Iowa's water monitoring network. See `CLAUDE.md` for the detailed technical contract between the app and the models (feature order, target transforms, metrics schema) if you're modifying the pipeline.
